# PickUpApp
## Day 1
On the first day, we sat together to share our ideas about our Project 3 application, whiteboarding two of our most solid ideas. We ultimately decided on PickUpApp and proceeded to map out our MVP, our wishlists, and got to work
## Day 2
Day two, we were down one team member due to illness, but with Zoom we were still able to have meetings and get our back end and front end started. We had seed data, and and were prepared to deploy.
## Day 3
DEPLOYMENT!!!

On the third day, we were still working through some bugs before deploying the front end, but our back end was deployed and talking to the front end. Our API was complete! One token was used.
## Day 4
ISSUES!!!!
We had a few hiccups,  with backend deployment and database seeding, and with front end deleting orders. We used one token.
## Day 5
CLEAN UP AND PRESENT!!!

We spent our final morning cleaning up our code, fine tuning our front end CSS, and preparing to present our project!
